{
  "verdict": "Fake",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "pixel_analysis_summary": {
    "suspicion_score": 0.38,
    "finding": "The CNN model, analyzing only the isolated facial region, reported a low suspicion score (0.38). This finding is noted but superseded by the critical contextual analysis."
  },
  "reasoning": "The final verdict is 'Fake' based on a critical and undeniable contextual failure. The system identified a clear anatomical impossibility in the image: the subject's hand plainly displays six fingers. This directly violates a core forensic principle retrieved from the knowledge base (doc_id 'anat_001'): 'Generative models often fail to render complex human anatomy correctly... Look for an incorrect number of fingers'. As per the analysis prompt's instructions, this critical logical failure overrides all other findings, including the low pixel-level score from the facial analysis."
